	abstract = {Detection and monitoring system of smoke concentration is very useful for places that tend to be flammable or area/room that are designated as non smoking area. This system is not only able to detect smoke but also determine the existence of point/source of smoke (areas where greater smoke concentrations are detected). The presence of smoke sources can be observed by monitoring systems with the addition of mobile camera trackers to focus on the presence of smoke sources. This system is very helpful to facilitate the building/room security officers in monitoring the smoke in their area, either smoke caused by fire or cigarette smoke in non smoking area. This research uses MQ-2 type smoke sensor, ATmega32 as controller, and also equipped with LCD display, monitor screen, and camera tracker. The test results prove that the system has been successfully integrated and able to achieve the desired target, that this system can be used properly to detect and monitor the presence of smoke sources.},

	abstract = {Along with the development of science and technology, problems often occur that threaten security at home. These problems originate from a level of security that does not meet security standards at home. Various problems that can threaten home security conditions are fire hazards that can be caused by neglect of home temperature regulation and electrochemical equipment that is uncontrolled by the homeowner or thief danger that can easily enter the house. The design of the home security system prototype is programmed and controlled by the NodeMCU ESP-8266 to transmit all data from sensor readings to the interface on the Cayenne dashboard. PIR sensor (HC-SR501) has a digital output, if the sensor detects a movement, the NodeMCU ESP-8266 will give a logical value of one. Gas sensor concentration (MQ-02) in testing has an average difference of 2.79 ppm (part per million). The reading results of all sensors will be measured through the Internet of Things interface displayed on the Cayenne dashboard, the simulated gas concentration with gas matches with the difference results, test results and analysis results of 2.79 ppm (part per million) and if the gas sensor (MQ -02) Exceeds the specified parameters, the buzzer will sound. PIR sensor testing (HC-SR501) will work optimally by human movement if at an angle of 45˚ because the success rate is 100\% in ten experiments and in the 90˚ angle the success rate is 80\%.},

	abstract = {In the past few decades many studies and researches have taken place in order to improve security systems and to increase their level of protection in different fields. One of the major problems that security must deal with is the fire outbreak that can happen in everywhere including houses, schools, factories and many other places, and to avoid that or to minimize the damage caused by fire outbreak an IoT technology is used to control such a kind of risk. IoT is a modern system that consist of sensors and switches connected. In this research we will use temperature sensor known as (Flame sensor) with Arduino device to detect fire outbreak and to measure the amount of heat intensity generated by a fire outbreak or in a specific location in our house, offices and other places. It sometimes takes too much time for the fire station to reach to the fire outbreak location and works on extinguish the fire and so these sensors will work as an early alarm system which will send a notification to our mobile phones if any fire outbreak occurred to let us know the situation clearly and before it’s too late, we act to avoid significant damage in case the fire outbreak was observed after a long time from its outbreak.},
