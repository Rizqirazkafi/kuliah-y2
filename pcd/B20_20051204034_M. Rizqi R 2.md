## Resources
There are quite a few dependencies that need to be satisfied in the system.
### Image sample
original image 100x100px:

![Original Image](image.jpg)


### Python Library
1. NumPy
   ```python
    pip install numpy 
   ```
2. Pillow
   ```python
    pip install Pillow 
   ```
### Python Source Code

1. Import numpy adn Pillow library
    ```python
    from PIL import Image
    from numpy import asarray
    ```

1. Open image as variable
   ```python
    image = Image.open('image.jpg')
   ```
1. crop image by storing it in a variable
   ```python
   croppedIm = image.crop((0,0,5,5))
   ```
   > (left, up, right, bottom)
1. show cropped image
   ```python
   croppedIm.show()
   ```
1. Save cropped image
   ```python
   croppedIm.save('croppedIm.jpg')
   ```
    ![cropped image](croppedIm.jpg)
1. Declare width and height of the croped image
   ```python
    width, height = croppedIm.size
   ```
1. Resize cropped image by 80 times without resampling it.
    ```python
    resizedCrIm=croppedIm.resize((width*80, height*80), resample=0)
    ```
1. Save resized image
    ```python
    resizedCrIm.save('RCI.jpg')
    ```
    ![Resized Cropped Image](RCI.jpg)
2. Convert image color to array using ` asarray` and store it as variable
    ```python
    np_img = asarray('image.jpg')
    ```
3. Print array
    ```python
    print(np_img)
    ```
4. Run program
   ```bash 
   python3 convert.py
   ```

5. Result color will display in RGB format. 
    ```python
    [y coorditnate[x coordinate]]
    ```
    ```python
    [[[  0   0   0]
      [255 255 255]
      [  0   0   0]
      [  0   0   0]
      [254 254 254]]
    
     [[  0   0   0]
      [255 255 255]
      [  0   0   0]
      [  0   0   0]
      [  0   0   0]]
    
     [[  0   0   0]
      [255 255 255]
      [  0   0   0]
      [  0   0   0]
      [  0   0   0]]
    
     [[255 255 255]
      [255 255 255]
      [  0   0   0]
      [  0   0   0]
      [255 255 255]]
    
     [[255 255 255]
      [255 255 255]
      [255 255 255]
      [255 255 255]
      [255 255 255]]]


    ```

### Explanation
Pillow library will return the value of the coordinate (0px,0px) in the image.jpg and continue scanning until the right pixel point of the image.
And then the process went on until the bottom right pixel of the image has scanned.
If we pick the first line output value.
```Python
[[[  0   0   0]
```
The first row is 0 which represent Red Channel Value in RGB pallet. While the second is Green and the third is Blue Channel
